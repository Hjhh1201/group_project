## Gameplay Mechanics

### Quantum Features

- Quantum States: Bricks and the ball have unique quantum states represented visually. The ball's quantum state changes due to a magnetic field affecting its trajectory. 


- Visual Effects: Quantum states are visualized on the ball and bricks using dynamic textures and materials that illustrate the qubit's orientation on the Bloch sphere.
